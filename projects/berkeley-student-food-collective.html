                        The Berkeley Student Food Collective (BSFC) is a
                        non-profit grocery store entirely run by volunteers.
                        BSFC began in 2008 when a group of students
                        successfully protested against the opening of a
                        Panda Express on the UC Berkeley campus as it was
                        unhealthy, unsustainable, and would ultimately
                        displace local food businesses. In 2009, founding
                        members of this movement sold produce from local
                        farmers markets at cost on Sproul Plaza in order to
                        provide accessible, fresh food options. The BSFC has
                        been dedicated to “<strong>providing</strong> fresh, local,
                        healthy, environmentally sustainable, and ethically
                        produced food at <strong>affordable</strong> prices to the
                        Berkeley campus and greater community” in addition
                        to “<strong>educating</strong> students about nutrition and
                        food systems, <strong>empowering</strong> new leaders, and
                        training youth to work in and manage a sustainable
                        business.”

                        In an effort to broaden the membership base and be
                        as reflective of the surrounding community as
                        possible, the BSFC asked the Invention Corps:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How might we <strong>attract</strong> and <strong>engage new members</strong> that are <strong>not currently represented</strong> in the collective?</li>
                        <li>How can we <strong>broaden our membership base</strong>?</li>
                        <li>How can we develop a <strong>tiered membership system</strong>?</li>
                        <li>How can we adjust <strong>incentives and obligations</strong> based on levels of membership?</li>
                        <li>How can we ensure that this initiative <strong>does not undermine</strong> our existing membership structure?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Our project mentors and the collective in general
                        recognize how important it is for the food
                        collective to be an accurate representation of the
                        community they aim to serve. Doing so allows them to
                        cater best to those who need the collective’s
                        products and services most acutely. It allows them
                        to make more holistic and productive decisions and
                        shape the future of the collective in the most
                        beneficial way possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We kicked off our project process with a meeting
                        with our project mentors in which our team fired
                        questions, confusions, and inquiries at our project
                        mentors, trying to learn more about the collective’s
                        pain points and attempting to face this social issue
                        head on instead of tip-toeing around it. The simple
                        action of coming to a third party to improve faults
                        they recognized within their organization shows the
                        thoughtful humility and deep self-awareness the
                        collective possesses. Our team was moved by our
                        mentors’ hunger to continuously improve the BSFC. We
                        learned the BSFC’s membership skewed towards
                        financial and systemic racial privilege. We learned
                        membership largely grew due to recommendations by
                        friends that were already collective members.

                    <p>
                        We began by doing a first round of classic ideation—
                        throwing out all ideas that came to mind, with no
                        idea being too big or too small.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These were some of the major ideas and themes we came up with:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Demographically quantify and understand current
                        store patrons to compare to members and note
                        differences</li>
                        <li>Properly understand food insecurity around campus</li>
                        <li>Develop personas for BSFC’s patrons </li>
                        <li>Develop a survey that addresses pain points of the BSFC</li>
                        <li>Survey loyal customers to determine what could entice them to become store members</li>
                        <li>Is the current leadership system effective? How can this be determined</li>
                        <li>How can the current membership incentive structure be changed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img class="bsfc-img" src="../assets/img/bsfc/bsfc-ideate.png" alt="Ideating Session Results" />

                    <p>After this ideation session, we set out to 1. conduct
                    in depth literature review 2. conduct a survey on
                    current BSFC members to acquire data 3. conduct in
                    person interviews with key organization officials
                    involved with the community and food insecurity. 1 was
                    meant to inform the questions we would develop; 2 would
                    acquire necessary data to maximize current membership; 3
                    was implemented to derive insights to attract
                    prospective members from the general community. </p>

                    <p>
                        For our literature review, we found that cooperative success and function, seemed to generally stem from:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A sense of community</li>
                        <li>A strict membership work requirement</li>
                        <li>A scaled benefits system</li>
                        <li>A bureaucratic leadership structure</li>
                        <li>Partnerships with other local businesses</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Below is our notion table, where we formulated key traits and practices of other food cooperatives as a team</p>

                    <p><strong>Below are the most important structural differences other food cooperatives have from BSFC that we took specific note of.</strong></p>

                            including household rule

                                family has to be a member for you to be able to shop
                                at the collective. Moreover, if anyone in the family
                                evades their duties, the entire family loses
                                privileges from the food collective.

                                may draw in prospective members that would seek more

                                Higher levels require more commitment, but
                                allow you to have more voting rights and power

                    <h4>User Interview of BSFC Membership</h4>
                    <p>
                        Next, we utilized this research to inform and modify polished survey questions, which we planned to administer to current BSFC members.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, with the unexpected advent of the
                        coronavirus and stay at home policies, our team was
                        suddenly forced to work remotely. Moreover, we
                        received note from our project mentors about how a
                        survey might be difficult to administer due to lower
                        response rates from the now dispersed membership.
                        Instead, we modified our approach, adopting the use
                        of personal user interviews instead of the mass
                        distribution of a general survey. We took this
                        approach because we also believed that an
                        individualized personal interview would evince more
                        detailed and in depth insights, which would not be
                        possible to derive from basic general surveys.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Below are key insights we derived from previous BSFC membership.</strong></p>
                    <q>
                        It’s a really big group, so it’s hard to get to
                        know people. Adding on to this, meetings are not
                        consistent and there isn’t accountability for
                        attendance. Together, these things make it really
                        hard to really see the food collective as a cohesive
                        community.
                    </q>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the large size of the collective and lax attendance restrictions for meetings have made it hard for members to feel connected with the BSFC as a true community</li>
                    </ul>
                    <q>
                        While the board members themselves are very
                        friendly, it is difficult to know who to talk to and
                        how, which makes it feel hard to be heard by the
                        leadership.
                    </q>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the leadership may seem friendly and open, but general members might not have easy access to info regarding who to talk to and the overall structural communication process</li>
                    </ul>
                    <q>
                        Different levels of incentive that scale with your
                        commitment would probably increase membership
                    </q>
                    <ul>
                        <li>members seem to prefer more flexibility with their membership, where commitment and governing voice in the club scale together</li>
                    </ul>
                    <q>
                        The discount wasn’t really the main reason for my
                        membership, it was more the ideas and principles
                        that the store stood for
                    </q>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the ideas and the principles the food collective stands behind are important inherent aspects of the membership itself; the discount is not the sole reason for every member's patronage</li>

                    <h4>User Interview of Key Figures Involved in Food Insecurity & Student Community</h4>
                    <p>For our last step, we conducted personal interviews with organization officials that were directly involved with food collectives and food insecurity.</p>

                            <li>
                                They offer a lot of cheap healthy options, but students don't know that they are a resource they can utilize

                        <li>
                            What do you think that the BSFC should do to increase membership?
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Recommends that BSFC do more promotional work on campus, marketing their location and messaging through flyering or design work.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When students want something to eat quickly they often just go to Walgreens, even though Berkeley Student Collective is right there

                            <li>
                                Should conduct pop-up events like the Food Pantry, i.e the Food Pantry sets up a mini-grocery store stand at key areas around campus to raise awareness

                            <li>
                                “Sometimes it's not about students coming to you, but you going to students so they know where you are present.”

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                BSFC is less in a marginalized community (later she clarifies she meant the black community) but is more in the Eco/sustainability community
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                BSFC is more appealing to white and Asian students because they are in the eco-friendly/sustainability spaces and often black students are not as welcome in those spaces (also not that many black students on campus 1-2% of total undergrad student population)

                            <li>

                                The Food Pantry went into the black community center and actively worked to build a bond and trust with those students.

                        The Berkeley Student Food Collective initially partnered with Invention Corps to address the following questions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How might we <strong>attract</strong> and <strong>engage new members</strong> that are <strong>not currently represented</strong> in the collective?</li>
                        <li>How can we <strong>broaden our membership base</strong>?</li>
                        <li>How can we develop a <strong>tiered membership system</strong>?</li>
                        <li>How can we adjust <strong>incentives and obligations</strong> based on levels of membership?</li>
                        <li>How can we ensure that this initiative <strong>does not undermine</strong> our existing membership structure?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Initially, our team researched other co-ops around
                        the country to compare their organizational
                        structure and success with the Berkeley Student Food
                        Collective (BSFC). We then used that research to
                        inform detailed survey questions. However, with the
                        sudden advent of the novel coronavirus and new
                        changes, we switched gears to utilize those
                        questions in a personalized interview with former
                        membership rather than administering a general
                        survey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, our team conducted interviews with the
                        director COFED and the recently elected
                        vice-president of student affairs in ASUC. These
                        insights enabled us to derive greater understanding
                        of the interconnection between the Berkeley student
                        community and food collectives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether it be greater engagement in marginalized
                        spaces, more emphasis on a tiered/scaled membership
                        system, or increasing community cohesion and
                        attendance in the club, our team has gathered an
                        array of recommendations and insights from detailed
                        literature review and user interviews with both
                        former BSFC members and key figures in the Berkeley
                        community that deal with food insecurity. Throughout
                        this entire document, we have provided a long and
                        comprehensive trove of information and recommended
                        strategies which we believe can enable the Berkeley
                        Food Collective to grow to new heights.

                        We would like to thank Jeff and Neeknaz for all the
                        support, information, and open communication they
                        have unendingly provided us. We would also like to
                        say thank you to Courtnie for checking in every week
                        and making sure that we always had all the tools we
                        needed to succeed. Through everybody's
                        contributions, we were able to conduct really
                        detailed and polished research, despite the recent
                        emergence of volatile and chaotic circumstances.
                        We're all firm supporters of what the Berkeley Food
                        Collective stands for, and hope that our work can
                        help streamline its future growth into success!
