                        <p>This semester we partnered with Cal Dining on their new food insecurity initiatives, Pizza with a Purpose and the Community Cafe. The purpose of the programs are to provide a stigma-free, healthy, and sustainable option for food insecure students on campus. Our unique perspective as Berkeley students, designers, and problem-solvers enabled us to provide fresh insights to the Cal Dining team. </p>

                            To create a "Community" Cafe, we first must understand and connect with the community this service is meant for. This process was rooted in three phases throughout the semester. We began with a large-scale kickoff event that would capture community attention. Then after the Coronavirus pandemic began, and many students moved off campus, we pivoted towards service for students still in Berkeley. With limited resources and infrastructure to support our ideas we decided to provide a report that would include an analysis of the issue of food insecurity in the greater Berkeley community and the resources available to support those who are food insecure. 
                        </p>
                        <h5>Phase 1: Kickoff Event Planning </h5>
                        <p>In early January, the Community Cafe team was optimistic that we would be able to plan a kickoff event for Pizza for a Purpose. This kickoff event would take place in early August of 2020 in conjunction with Calapalooza. Under these assumptions, we brainstormed various ideas that would draw students to Pizza for a Purpose, but also explain the larger function behind Pizza for a Purpose and Community Cafe. Our ideating sessions resulted in many ideas: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The Great Pizza Bakeoff</strong></li>
                            This bakeoff would invite students to design and make their own pizza in Crossroads on a designated day. Then a celebrity guest judge would pick their favorite. Some of the celebrity judges in mind were David Dobrik, The Boba Guys, and Gavin Newsom. To encourage student participation the winning pizza would be named after the student and be featured on the menu at Pizza for a Purpose. 
                            <li style="padding-top: 5px;"><strong>Glade-bounce</strong></li>
                            This idea was inspired by middle school days when our schools would have bounce houses on the school football field to reward students for a semester well-done. We planned to have students buy carnival tickets shaped like pizzas in order to gain entry to the bouncy houses. Outside of each bounce house students, there would be student volunteers talking about different topics of food insecurity before students are able to get in the bouncy houses. We would of course serve Pizza with a Purpose pizzas as well at this event to draw attention to the quality of the product. 
                            <li style="padding-top: 5px;"><strong>Flash Pizza's</strong></li>
                            This idea was inspired by flash dances, but instead of surprising students with cool dance moves, we would be surprising students with free pizzas. This was our team's favorite idea for the ingenuity as well as the ability to go viral on @barstoolberkeley on Instagram, Berkeley Facebook groups, or other social media platforms and truly market Community Cafe in an innovative way. 
                        </ul>  
                        <h5>Phase 2: Food Kits</h5>
                        <p>As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, students quickly filed out of Berkeley, and the ones left were left with a choice between few options: </p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 3%;">
                            <li>prepackaged meals from the dining halls (if they have a meal plan)</li>

                            <li style="padding-top: 5px;">depending on takeout from the few restaurants that remained open in Berkeley.</li>
                        </ul>  
                        <p>Our solution to these inconvenient food options was "food-kits". A "food-kit" would contain various vegetables and other groceries that the dining halls possessed being sold at discount prices compared to local grocery stores to students. This solution would simultaneously alleviate the problem of food surplus at the dining halls. We would also model our food kits after Hello Fresh and include different recipes uploaded on various social media platforms by either fellow students or dining hall chefs. While this product would have alleviated the financial burden of accessing healthy food for students still in Berkeley, the logistical barriers of providing such a service (having boots-on-the-ground to package the food, delays in obtaining clearance from the university, etc.) led us to our final pivot in regards to community engagement. </p>
                        <h5>Phase 3: Food Insecurity Report - Final Deliverable</h5>
                        <p>Coronavirus has shaken the global economy and its effects will be felt for years, but one of its most immediate, observable effects is decreasing access to affordable, healthy food as mentioned above. All Berkeley residents, not just students, are suffering from some form of food insecurity as a result. To work in the space of food accessibility, we must now understand how the issue has been exacerbated due to the health crisis. </p>
                        <p>We conducted user interviews with:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 3%;">
                            <li>Students experiencing food insecurity</li>
                            <li style="padding-top: 5px;">Members of the UC system who work in alleviating food insecurity among students</li>
                            <li style="padding-top: 5px;">External organizations combating food insecurity in the greater East Bay community</li>
                        </ul>  
                        <p>We summarized the major points of these interviews here (HYPERLINK TO MEDIUM ARTICLE). This article represents the unique perspectives of individuals either directly affected by this crisis or working to provide new, innovative solutions as well as provides a glimpse into what the future of food insecurity may look like. Understanding these perspectives and what the future of food insecurity holds is crucial for the success of the Community Cafe and any future services aiming to reduce food insecurity on a large scale.  </p>

                            After we conducted our interviews, we discussed each
                            of our key insights and identified common problems
                            and findings. We found several prominent insights

                        <h4>Interview Key Findings</h4>
                        <p>
                            In our initial meetings, the team and mentors hosted
                            a brainstorming session where we outlined important
                            platform features and a basic user flow. This
                            defined platform "skeleton" acted as a guiding
                            pillar as the strategy and user interface teams
                            moved forward in development. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We mapped out are ideas on a whiteboard so that we could easily visualize and elaborate on our ideas. 
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Key features we developed were:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Establish student credibility</li>
                            <li>Project preference forms</li>
                            <li>Ways to discover projects </li>
                            <li>A project filtering system</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Our basic user flow:</strong></p>

                        <p>
                            We split into two sub-teams: Strategy Team and User Interface Team. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The strategy team consisted of Leo, Abhi and Laurel.
                            This team worked with James to design the Pilot
                            Program (the experience for mentors and users) and
                            developed the project logistically from the mentor’s
                            side.                         
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Final Goal: </strong>The ultimate goal was the design of the Pilot Program and a growth strategy for Groupsource.</p>
                        <h4>Logistics Document</h4>
                        <p>
                            The logistics document was the home of the strategy
                            team, housing the majority of our meeting
                            information, compiled questions for students and
                            mentors, and where we developed our strategy for the
                            pilot program. In the document we moved to
                            establish:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The structure of the Pilot Program and its Requirements</li>
                            <li>Mechanisms for Student Matching</li>
                            <li>Requirements for Mentors</li>
                            <li>Project Proposals</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>These are broken down further below:</p>
                        <h4>Pilot Program - Students' Perspective</h4>
                        <p>
                            From the student's side the important thing was
                            brainstorming factors to consider for <em>Project
                            Matching</em> - what was important for Student's to have
                            before going in and what were their goals after the
                            project? 
                        </p>
                        <img class="md-img center-img" src="../assets/img/groupsource/Strategy Team/Showcase Visuals/Matching Factors.png" alt="Matching Factors" />
                        <p>These factors were built from our original two
                        personas Joe and Lily. In addition we developed a survey
                        called the <em>Learning Goals Skills Check</em> to ensure that
                        students' desired outcomes, whether it be technical
                        skills or in-field experience, is being achieved as the
                        project progressed, to be integrated into our Business
                        Process Flow Diagrams</p>
                        <h4>Pilot Program - Project Mentor's Perspective</h4>
                        <p>
                            A huge component of the mentor side is mentors, and
                            seeing what qualities are most pertinent for our
                            mentors. A huge component of that is their intended
                            learning plan or <em>Curriculum</em> for students, which
                            would consist of a general timeline of the project
                            and how they hope to help the students' achieve
                            their Learning Goals. From these we drafted template
                            questions for our mentors:
                        </p>

                        <h4>Business Process Flow Charts</h4>
                        <p>
                            Amongst all the previous factors and considerations,
                            an integral component of the Strategy Team's goals
                            was to ideate the Pilot Program experience, which
                            was achieved through Business Process Flow Charts
                            (BPFCs). The team initially split up creating four
                            individual BPFCs before integrating all of them into
                            one centralized BPFCs as shown below
                        </p>
                        <iframe id="xls-embed" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQVmXS3BN1qMPKthOTfuTbqRnDd1YC_34J6lCop_cn9chmfl9tp757UX-fa22xayQ/pubhtml?gid=1056765694&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>
                        <p>
                            The Above BPFCs runs on a project that lasts 10 weeks. In the "Pre-Project" stage, the three important aspects included:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Project Parameter Definition</strong> - Project Leaders,
                            based on responses to the project factors during
                            their on-boarding, develop an initial plan and
                            framework for the <em>Curriculum</em> not only achieve the
                            project goals but ensure student's can achieve
                            potential <em>Learning Goals</em></li>
                            <li><strong>Project Preference Form </strong>- Students fill in the
                            on-boarding <em>Project Preference Form (PPF)</em> and
                            describe their desired <em>Learning Goals</em> </li>
                            <li><strong>Project Matching and Curriculum Development </strong>-
                            Based on the PPF, groupsource will match students to
                            their desired project and work with the Project
                            Mentors to develop their frameworks into a full
                            fledged <em>Curriculum</em></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            As the project progresses, there are periodic weekly
                            check-ins called <em>Learning Goals Skill Checks</em> which
                            students will fill out. Based on this, Project
                            Mentors and Groupsource will work together to adjust
                            the curriculum on a dynamic basis as the timeline
                            progresses. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many of these aspects require hands on involvement
                            from Groupsource, especially in the Pilot Program.
                            However with scale, the nature of Groupsource's
                            involvement will become more supervisory as an
                            exemplar project timeline evolves.

                        <p>
                            The UI team consisted of Maya and Isabella. This
                            team created hi-fidelity wireframes of Groupsource's
                            web application outlining the student user flow.
                        </p>
                        <h4>User Flow</h4>
                        <p>
                            We started our process by creating a user flow to
                            help clearly outline the pathways and interactions
                            of the website. This was also helpful to have more
                            direction when creating our Figma screens. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To outline the basic flow, a user starts with the

                            and save ones they like. From the saved projects,
                            users choose which to apply to.  Once users create
                            an account, they gain a dashboard which is where
                            users have a profile, can see saved projects, and
                            apply to projects.

                        <p>We made the header simple and bold, with two tones
                        that can be adjusted accordingly to the background. We
                        opted for a lowercase spelling to appear more casual and
                        for students.</p>

                            Our color choices stem from current UI color
                            trends—purple is a very stable, gentle, yet mystic
                            color, and we thought that would be perfect for a
                            platform that runs on the creativity and success of
                            its users.

                            The last design element we want to feature is our
                            illustrations. We created a whole illustration pack,
                            intended for use throughout the platform. While we
                            didn't get to implement it in this version,
                            hopefully they will be used as pieces for user
                            onboarding process or homepage assets in the future!

                            We can break the functionalities into 3 parts: searching
                            for projects, creating an account, and organizing your
                            profile and saved projects within your dashboard.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Searching for projects</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Users can explore projects by filtering by area of
                            study, time span, industry, etc. Users can save projects
                            they like, which will then be stored in their dashboard.

                            In order to save a project, user's must create an
                            account. We collaborated with the strategy team to
                            identify the key information we would want from
                            students.

                        <h4>Dashboard</h4>
                        <p>
                            Once a user creates an account, they gain a
                            dashboard. The dashboard includes a profile to
                            organize past experiences and skills, a place to see
                            saved projects and choose which to apply to, and a
                            place to store ongoing projects. Students can only
                            apply to projects from their saved project list and
                            are allowed to apply up to 5 projects at a time. We
                            set these restrictions to  differentiate our
                            platform from other job sites and to enforce
                            students to make more conscious choices when
                            applying to projects. Our hope is to have students
                            only apply to projects they feel passionate about.

                            The team had a wonderful time collaborating with
                            Groupsource and its founders on this project.
                            Because the project was at the early stages of
                            development, we were able to play a large role in
                            taking Groupsource from an idea to a prototyped
                            platform. While performing user interviews,
                            solidifying platform features and goals, and
                            iterating through user interface prototypes; team
                            members had the opportunities to grow individually
                            through their contributions and make a lasting
                            impact on a promising company. Team members learned
                            Figma skills, business strategy techniques,
                            successful interview structures and creative
                            thinking. We look forward to seeing Groupsource
                            interface with a new generation of learners.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Moving forwards, we hope to publish a Groupsource
                            landing page and ultimately an official website
                            using the Figma prototype we created. In tandem, we
                            will also be coordinating the pilot program by
                            solidifying the list of mentors and students that
                            will participate. With development comes lots of
                            user testing. In the beginning we plan on actively
                            adapting the platform given feedback and testing.
