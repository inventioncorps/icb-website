              <p> Alemany Farm is a nonprofit urban farm that focused on helping alleviate food deserts and lack of access to nutritious produce. One of the issues that they faced was tracking and documenting the various tasks completed by their volunteers within the orchards around the farm. Invention Corps members were tasked with finding and designing a solution on how track these activities. </p>
              <p> How might we create a system for multiple volunteers to find, track, and document trees on the farm?</p>

                      <p> Our team first began our design process by traveling to the farm to interview the users in order to gain a better perspective on their pain points. We learned that Alemany Farm were using a simple map and numbering system to locate trees, with no universal method for documenting what they had done for the day. This meant that other volunteers would often repeat treatments, miss certain trees, and couldn’t communicate with volunteers from other shifts. </p>
                    <p> After the tour, we headed back to campus to brainstorm ideas and prototype possible solutions.</p>

                      <p> After some discussion, we determined that an app was the best way to solve their issue. The majority, if not all, of the volunteers at Alemany Farm had an iPhone, so we decided to wireframe a design for an iOS app. We wanted to keep in mind the setting that they would be utilizing the app in and opted for faster inputs using an interface composed of buttons. </p>

                      <p> Features we wanted to add:
                        <ul>
                          <li> QR Scanner to easily scan trees and add new inputs into their unique ID</li>
                          <li> Search function to find trees and their history of care/output</li>
                          <li> A map to geographically locate, add, or delete trees</li>
                          <li> Status/flagging system to help locate trees who need immediate care</li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>
                      <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-8">

                        </div>
                      </div>

                      <p> We wanted the flow of the app to be as concise as possible for each action that the Alemany Farm team may want. This meant that the moment you logged into the app, you would be sent straight to the QR code scanner to input tree data, the most commonly done task. For other features, a taskbar at the bottom with 4 buttons to switch between functions were available.
                      </p>

                      <p> With multiple rounds of ideating, wireframing, and discussion, we finally had a set idea as to how we wanted the app and workflow to function. It was time to work on a Figma design to solidify our ideas as a team.</p>

                    <div class="col-lg-9" style="font-style: normal;">
                      <p> We worked collaboratively on a single wireframe, with each one of us adding pages that we were assigned and then tying them together into one cohesive project. Thanks to the consistent communication of our mentors, we were able to generate feedback and reiterate multiple times to continue to optimize our designs.</p>

                        </div>
                      </div>


                      <p>After finishing up the wireframe, our team of coders (essentially everyone except me) began working on creating a functioning product. We first started development by partitioning our group into backend and frontend roles. Frontend is what the user sees and interacts with such as buttons, icons, images, while backend is the code that runs behind the scenes. Thus, front end is much more design focused while backend was much more programming focused. As such, we tried to give everyone roles that suit both of their interests and skillset. Ultimately this ended up with Kaylan, Shantaam, and Qianning on the front end team, with Zeyad on the backend team. Unfortunately, xcode is specific to mac users, so Ryan was unable to assist us in development. </p>
                      <p>There were two main technical problems we solved while building this app: Reading and writing tree data, and using a qr scanner to recognize trees. In order to hold both the data for users and as well as all the tree data, we used Google’s Firebase Realtime Database, a database that integrates seamlessly with Xcode and allows us to quickly see updates as well as who made those updates. To implement the QR code reader, we used the AV Foundation Library, a native library that contains many functions for interacting with an iPhone’s camera. </p>
                      <p>Our general development cycle consists as follows: A member of the front end team completes a page of the application and pushes it to GitHub. Then, Zeyad would pull the updated app from GitHub and complete the backend code for that specific page. At the same time, the next front end developer in the rotation would start working on the next page in the cycle, and upon completing that Zeyad would fill in his backend portion for that page, and so on and so forth. </p>

                      <p> We decided to create an iOS app that had the functionality the Alemany Farm team would need while working to take care of the orchards. When determining the features of the app, we wanted to keep in mind the environment that the app would be utilized within. This means the app should quickly accessible as well as easily navigated after the care for each tree was completed. Efficiency and ease of use was key. </p>
                      <p> Additionally, the team at Alemany Farm requested a way to navigate the farm in a more efficient way. We decided to implement a live map that would allow for both easy addition and removal of tree locations, as the farm was constantly growing to add new trees while digging up low fruit yield ones.</p>
                      <p> Data was another concern, specifically visualization and record keeping. We implemented designs that would allow for certain metrics to be kept to each unique tree ID, while also for them to be generated into graphs for analytical purposes</p>
                      <p> We also wanted to be mindful of the cost of record keeping for the trees, and decided QR codes would be the best option. Below is a showcase of our final Figma wireframe and the different functions we included.</p>

                      <p> From our dear project lead Kaylan:</p>
                      <p> “In a rewarding semester full of growth and team building, our group communicated incredibly well within itself despite the circumstances of the pandemic changing the work flow of our project. With all of our meetings moved online, every member put extra effort into learning new skills through online meetings and tutorials, as many of us tried to tackle iOS development or wire-framing for the first time. With much of the project based in new experiences for our members and with an equal excitement for our work reflected in our mentors, our team gained a lot in terms of growth and partnership. Though we would have liked to accomplish more of the end phases of iOS development, our project team has accomplished a feat we’re proud of in the span of a semester despite the unique circumstances. Especially for the two graduating seniors leading the team, it was an incredible and memorable way to leave Berkeley and this chapter of our lives.”</p>
