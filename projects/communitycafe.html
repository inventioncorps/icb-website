            With the big-picture aim of creating avenues to relieve food-insecure students on UC Berkeley's campus, our team partnered with Cal Dining to pilot new initiatives with sustainable resources and a strong brand identity in order to best engage and educate students about food insecurity.

                        <p>This semester we partnered with Cal Dining on their new food insecurity initiatives, Pizza with a Purpose and the Community Cafe. The purpose of the programs are to provide a stigma-free, healthy, and sustainable option for food insecure students on campus. Our unique perspective as Berkeley students, designers, and problem-solvers enabled us to provide fresh insights to the Cal Dining team. </p>

                            To create a "Community" Cafe, we first must understand and connect with the community this service is meant for. This process was rooted in three phases throughout the semester. We began with a large-scale kickoff event that would capture community attention. Then after the Coronavirus pandemic began, and many students moved off campus, we pivoted towards service for students still in Berkeley. With limited resources and infrastructure to support our ideas we decided to provide a report that would include an analysis of the issue of food insecurity in the greater Berkeley community and the resources available to support those who are food insecure. 
                        </p>
                        <h5>Phase 1: Kickoff Event Planning </h5>
                        <p>In early January, the Community Cafe team was optimistic that we would be able to plan a kickoff event for Pizza for a Purpose. This kickoff event would take place in early August of 2020 in conjunction with Calapalooza. Under these assumptions, we brainstormed various ideas that would draw students to Pizza for a Purpose, but also explain the larger function behind Pizza for a Purpose and Community Cafe. Our ideating sessions resulted in many ideas: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The Great Pizza Bakeoff</strong></li>
                            This bakeoff would invite students to design and make their own pizza in Crossroads on a designated day. Then a celebrity guest judge would pick their favorite. Some of the celebrity judges in mind were David Dobrik, The Boba Guys, and Gavin Newsom. To encourage student participation the winning pizza would be named after the student and be featured on the menu at Pizza for a Purpose. 
                            <li style="padding-top: 5px;"><strong>Glade-bounce</strong></li>
                            This idea was inspired by middle school days when our schools would have bounce houses on the school football field to reward students for a semester well-done. We planned to have students buy carnival tickets shaped like pizzas in order to gain entry to the bouncy houses. Outside of each bounce house students, there would be student volunteers talking about different topics of food insecurity before students are able to get in the bouncy houses. We would of course serve Pizza with a Purpose pizzas as well at this event to draw attention to the quality of the product. 
                            <li style="padding-top: 5px;"><strong>Flash Pizza's</strong></li>
                            This idea was inspired by flash dances, but instead of surprising students with cool dance moves, we would be surprising students with free pizzas. This was our team's favorite idea for the ingenuity as well as the ability to go viral on @barstoolberkeley on Instagram, Berkeley Facebook groups, or other social media platforms and truly market Community Cafe in an innovative way.

                        <h5>Phase 2: Food Kits</h5>
                        <p>As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, students quickly filed out of Berkeley, and the ones left were left with a choice between few options: </p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 3%;">
                            <li>prepackaged meals from the dining halls (if they have a meal plan)</li>
                            <li style="padding-top: 5px;">traveling to distant grocery stores by bus or foot</li>
                            <li style="padding-top: 5px;">depending on takeout from the few restaurants that remained open in Berkeley.</li>
                        </ul>  
                        <p>Our solution to these inconvenient food options was "food-kits". A "food-kit" would contain various vegetables and other groceries that the dining halls possessed being sold at discount prices compared to local grocery stores to students. This solution would simultaneously alleviate the problem of food surplus at the dining halls. We would also model our food kits after Hello Fresh and include different recipes uploaded on various social media platforms by either fellow students or dining hall chefs. While this product would have alleviated the financial burden of accessing healthy food for students still in Berkeley, the logistical barriers of providing such a service (having boots-on-the-ground to package the food, delays in obtaining clearance from the university, etc.) led us to our final pivot in regards to community engagement. </p>
                        <h5>Phase 3: Food Insecurity Report - Final Deliverable</h5>
                        <p>Coronavirus has shaken the global economy and its effects will be felt for years, but one of its most immediate, observable effects is decreasing access to affordable, healthy food as mentioned above. All Berkeley residents, not just students, are suffering from some form of food insecurity as a result. To work in the space of food accessibility, we must now understand how the issue has been exacerbated due to the health crisis. </p>
                        <p>We conducted user interviews with:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 3%;">
                            <li>Students experiencing food insecurity</li>
                            <li style="padding-top: 5px;">Members of the UC system who work in alleviating food insecurity among students</li>
                            <li style="padding-top: 5px;">External organizations combating food insecurity in the greater East Bay community</li>

                        <h5 style="">Ideating</h5>
                        <p>
                            We started off by identifying everything we hated about current pizza boxes and brainstorming ways to reinvent how the pizza box is designed and used. We focused on ideas that would make our pizza box stand out, while being sustainable and eco-friendly.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Research</h5>
                        <p>
                            We researched the most innovative pizza boxes we could find, drawing inspiration from the likes of Apple, Greenbox and Pinterest. In order to ensure our pizza box was sustainable, we researched different material options to ensure cohesiveness between our brand and our actions.  We contacted numerous suppliers and manufacturers for quotes on available pizza boxes, and analyzed the cost versus benefit of each.                        </p>

                        <h5>Design</h5>
                        <p>
                            Upon recognizing that the cost of reinventing the pizza box did not outweigh the benefit, we focused our attention on designing the graphics on the box. We put together a series of different design concepts that we found to be effective so we had options to choose from once we fully understood our brand identity.                        
                        </p>
                        <div class="row">

                        </div>
                        <p>Of the the many different design concepts, some of our favorites revolved around black print to give the box an artisanal feel. We also wanted to make our customers feel connected to our brand by including detailed graphics for the customer to engage with. Because we are marketing to Cal students, I tried to combine these concepts into a graphic that Cal students could uniquely identify with and feel connected to.</p>

                        <h5>Ideating</h5>
                        <p>In the ideation phase, we took a lot of inspiration from Pinterest for signage, menu design, wall design, and overall space atmosphere. In this initial process, we sought big picture ideas to get a feel for how we envisioned the end product. We explored different ways to add character to the space within the guidelines set by Cal Dining. </p>

                        <h5>Menus</h5>
                        <p>During menu creation, we experimented with different ways to make Pizza With a Purpose unique to the Berkeley community (i.e. naming the pizzas after campus trademarks). After deciding that we preferred an artisan, rustic undertone over a colorful, school-spirit effect, we  progressed with our space designs and different concepts for wall decorations.</p>

                        <p>In this phase, we experimented with different color schemes and brainstormed ways to inform the audience about the purpose of the Community Cafe and Pizza with a Purpose (to eradicate food insecurity on the UC Berkeley campus). We decided that an infographic that runs along the counters and walls would be effective in staying aligned with the brand of the two establishments, while simultaneously conveying the message we wanted to share with the public. </p>

After receiving feedback from Joe, our project mentor, we experimented with different ways to integrate the name into the logo, as well as various combinations of color palettes and typography. </p>
