                We are team groupsource! For our project, we wanted
                to tackle the problem of students' being unprepared
                for the work world due to the lack of real world and
                relevant experience. Throughout this semester we
                were able to work alongside our mentors James
                Hamilton and Riley Campbell. During this project we
                conducted user interviews, created personas,
                ideated, and prototyped to make gaining relevant
                experience more accessible to students. We created
                high fidelity wireframes and a pilot program for a
                platform that connects students with relevant,
                impactful projects.

                            Our team had the pleasure of partnering with
                            Groupsource, a company and platform founded by James
                            Hamilton and Riley Campbell that aims to connect
                            inexperienced college students with professional
                            opportunities where they can make meaningful
                            contributions and develop their skillsets. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Both James and Riley served as our mentors
                            throughout the design process. They helped us stay
                            on course when defining deliverables, discussing
                            business models, and prototyping the platform. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We set out to answer the question "<strong>How might
                            we connect students with professional and relevant
                            experiences to better prepare students for the work
                            world.</strong>" It is difficult for students in
                            college to build a skillset and project portfolio in
                            a field they are interested in without involvement
                            in highly selective campus clubs or pre-established
                            networking connections.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Inspired by organizations like Invention Corps that
                            connect students with companies via semester long
                            projects, one goal of Groupsource is to increase
                            accessibility to opportunities that would prepare
                            students for the workforce. We aimed to build a
                            platform that connects students with organizations
                            such as startups, non-profits, professors, etc that
                            would benefit from student work.  As an open-to-all
                            platform, Groupsource would remove typical barriers
                            to student involvement such as inexperience, limited
                            campus organization selection, and competitiveness.
                            We defined project goals that pushed us to explore
                            the needs of our target population, the structure of
                            our programs, and our ideal customer outcomes.

                            know from students and created a user interview
                            guide. We started with some context questions such
                            as "do you have any internship/work experience while
                            in college?".  We then asked questions that dove
                            deeper into their past experiences to understand the
                            current pathways students take to gain relevant
                            experience. Our last section asked questions about
                            our proposed solution idea to get initial insights
                            about students thoughts of our idea.

                        <p>
                            After we conducted our interviews, we discussed each
                            of our key insights and identified common problems
                            and findings. We found several prominent insights
                            that we kept in mind when ideating and creating our
                            groupsource platform.

                        <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
                        <p>
                            In our initial meetings, the team and mentors hosted
                            a brainstorming session where we outlined important
                            platform features and a basic user flow. This
                            defined platform "skeleton" acted as a guiding
                            pillar as the strategy and user interface teams
                            moved forward in development. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We mapped out are ideas on a whiteboard so that we could easily visualize and elaborate on our ideas. 
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Key features we developed were:</strong></p>

                        <p>
                            We split into two sub-teams: Strategy Team and User Interface Team. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The strategy team consisted of Leo, Abhi and Laurel.
                            This team worked with James to design the Pilot
                            Program (the experience for mentors and users) and
                            developed the project logistically from the mentor’s
                            side.                         
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Final Goal: </strong>The ultimate goal was the design of the Pilot Program and a growth strategy for Groupsource.</p>
                        <h4>Logistics Document</h4>
                        <p>
                            The logistics document was the home of the strategy
                            team, housing the majority of our meeting
                            information, compiled questions for students and
                            mentors, and where we developed our strategy for the
                            pilot program. In the document we moved to
                            establish:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The structure of the Pilot Program and its Requirements</li>
                            <li>Mechanisms for Student Matching</li>
                            <li>Requirements for Mentors</li>
                            <li>Project Proposals</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>These are broken down further below:</p>
                        <h4>Pilot Program - Students' Perspective</h4>
                        <p>
                            From the student's side the important thing was
                            brainstorming factors to consider for <em>Project
                            Matching</em> - what was important for Student's to have
                            before going in and what were their goals after the
                            project? 
                        </p>
                        <img class="md-img center-img" src="../assets/img/groupsource/Strategy Team/Showcase Visuals/Matching Factors.png" alt="Matching Factors" />
                        <p>These factors were built from our original two
                        personas Joe and Lily. In addition we developed a survey
                        called the <em>Learning Goals Skills Check</em> to ensure that
                        students' desired outcomes, whether it be technical
                        skills or in-field experience, is being achieved as the
                        project progressed, to be integrated into our Business
                        Process Flow Diagrams</p>
                        <h4>Pilot Program - Project Mentor's Perspective</h4>
                        <p>
                            A huge component of the mentor side is mentors, and
                            seeing what qualities are most pertinent for our
                            mentors. A huge component of that is their intended
                            learning plan or <em>Curriculum</em> for students, which
                            would consist of a general timeline of the project
                            and how they hope to help the students' achieve
                            their Learning Goals. From these we drafted template
                            questions for our mentors:

                        <h4>Business Process Flow Charts</h4>
                        <p>
                            Amongst all the previous factors and considerations,
                            an integral component of the Strategy Team's goals
                            was to ideate the Pilot Program experience, which
                            was achieved through Business Process Flow Charts
                            (BPFCs). The team initially split up creating four
                            individual BPFCs before integrating all of them into
                            one centralized BPFCs as shown below
                        </p>
                        <iframe id="xls-embed" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQVmXS3BN1qMPKthOTfuTbqRnDd1YC_34J6lCop_cn9chmfl9tp757UX-fa22xayQ/pubhtml?gid=1056765694&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>
                        <p>
                            The Above BPFCs runs on a project that lasts 10 weeks. In the "Pre-Project" stage, the three important aspects included:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Project Parameter Definition</strong> - Project Leaders,
                            based on responses to the project factors during
                            their on-boarding, develop an initial plan and
                            framework for the <em>Curriculum</em> not only achieve the
                            project goals but ensure student's can achieve
                            potential <em>Learning Goals</em></li>
                            <li><strong>Project Preference Form </strong>- Students fill in the
                            on-boarding <em>Project Preference Form (PPF)</em> and
                            describe their desired <em>Learning Goals</em> </li>
                            <li><strong>Project Matching and Curriculum Development </strong>-
                            Based on the PPF, groupsource will match students to
                            their desired project and work with the Project
                            Mentors to develop their frameworks into a full
                            fledged <em>Curriculum</em></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            As the project progresses, there are periodic weekly
                            check-ins called <em>Learning Goals Skill Checks</em> which
                            students will fill out. Based on this, Project
                            Mentors and Groupsource will work together to adjust
                            the curriculum on a dynamic basis as the timeline
                            progresses. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many of these aspects require hands on involvement
                            from Groupsource, especially in the Pilot Program.
                            However with scale, the nature of Groupsource's
                            involvement will become more supervisory as an
                            exemplar project timeline evolves.

                        <p>
                            The UI team consisted of Maya and Isabella. This
                            team created hi-fidelity wireframes of Groupsource's
                            web application outlining the student user flow.
                        </p>
                        <h4>User Flow</h4>
                        <p>
                            We started our process by creating a user flow to
                            help clearly outline the pathways and interactions
                            of the website. This was also helpful to have more
                            direction when creating our Figma screens.

                            To outline the basic flow, a user starts with the
                            home page, then they can start looking for a project
                            and save ones they like. From the saved projects,
                            users choose which to apply to.  Once users create
                            an account, they gain a dashboard which is where
                            users have a profile, can see saved projects, and
                            apply to projects.

                        <p>We made the header simple and bold, with two tones
                        that can be adjusted accordingly to the background. We
                        opted for a lowercase spelling to appear more casual and
                        for students.</p>

                            Our color choices stem from current UI color
                            trends—purple is a very stable, gentle, yet mystic
                            color, and we thought that would be perfect for a
                            platform that runs on the creativity and success of
                            its users.

                            The last design element we want to feature is our
                            illustrations. We created a whole illustration pack,
                            intended for use throughout the platform. While we
                            didn't get to implement it in this version,
                            hopefully they will be used as pieces for user
                            onboarding process or homepage assets in the future!

                            We can break the functionalities into 3 parts: searching
                            for projects, creating an account, and organizing your
                            profile and saved projects within your dashboard.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Searching for projects</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Users can explore projects by filtering by area of
                            study, time span, industry, etc. Users can save projects
                            they like, which will then be stored in their dashboard.

                        <p>
                            In order to save a project, user's must create an
                            account. We collaborated with the strategy team to
                            identify the key information we would want from
                            students.

                        <h4>Dashboard</h4>
                        <p>
                            Once a user creates an account, they gain a
                            dashboard. The dashboard includes a profile to
                            organize past experiences and skills, a place to see
                            saved projects and choose which to apply to, and a
                            place to store ongoing projects. Students can only
                            apply to projects from their saved project list and
                            are allowed to apply up to 5 projects at a time. We
                            set these restrictions to  differentiate our
                            platform from other job sites and to enforce
                            students to make more conscious choices when
                            applying to projects. Our hope is to have students
                            only apply to projects they feel passionate about.

                            Because the project was at the early stages of
                            development, we were able to play a large role in
                            taking Groupsource from an idea to a prototyped
                            platform. While performing user interviews,
                            solidifying platform features and goals, and
                            iterating through user interface prototypes; team
                            members had the opportunities to grow individually
                            through their contributions and make a lasting
                            impact on a promising company. Team members learned
                            Figma skills, business strategy techniques,
                            successful interview structures and creative
                            thinking. We look forward to seeing Groupsource
                            interface with a new generation of learners.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Moving forwards, we hope to publish a Groupsource
                            landing page and ultimately an official website
                            using the Figma prototype we created. In tandem, we
                            will also be coordinating the pilot program by
                            solidifying the list of mentors and students that
                            will participate. With development comes lots of
                            user testing. In the beginning we plan on actively
                            adapting the platform given feedback and testing.
