                    created by the University Innovation Fellows as part of the effort to increase undergraduate innovation and
                    entrepreneurship throughout UC Berkeley. Since our beginnings, we have always championed multidisciplinary designers,

                    design consulting organizations, we offer pro-bono partnerships and high quality deliverables as part of our dedication
                    toward positive social impact.

    <p id="end">The initial concept of collaborative design-thinking, ideating, and inventing remains a crucial and ever-evolving
    process of our club. Hence, we have no formal recruitment process (resumes, portfolios, etc.) and instead gauge creative
    and collaborative skills through design challenges. Likewise, our club is completely operated by undergraduates and each
    member has equal responsibility and agency in sustaining and improving our community.
