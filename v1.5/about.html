<h2> WELCOME TO ICB</h2>

<!--Our MISSION section-->
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <h4>Our Mission</h4>
            <p> We are Invention Corps of Berkeley. As a collective, we are an interdisciplinary group of students driven to create
            meaningful global impact through human-centered design. We partner with people and organizations with the objective of
            creating tangible solutions in the realms of society, health, poverty, and the environment. </p>
            
            <p> Our club hosts a semesterly showcase to share the work we have done on our projects typically with presentations and
            live demos. This semester, we present our **Virtual Showcase**. Our theme this semester is *String Theory*. As the
            pandemic has forced many of us apart, we were inspired by the natural forces keeping us together, which you'll see our
            interpretations of throughout the website. </p>
            
            <p> To adapt our tradition of creating a large-scale physical art piece, we were challenged to reimagine something virtually
            collaborative and engaging. Deriving inspiration from the idea of the necessary and inevitable reaction of particles, we
            created a structure of interacting, free-form 'blobs'. Each blob was designed individually by each of our amazingly
            unique members, visually created as a representation of themselves and the color that represents them. </p>
